// In Dart, the primary keywords for declaring variables are 
// var, const, final, and dynamic.
//  The keyword let does not exist in Dart (it is used in JavaScript).
//   The var keyword is used to declare variables whose type is determined at runtime.
//    The const keyword is used to declare variables whose values cannot be changed.
//     The final keyword is used to declare variables whose values cannot be changed after they are initialized.
//      The dynamic keyword is used to declare variables whose type can change during runtime.
